Write queries for following scenarios
Use Northwind database. All questions are based on assumptions described by the Database Diagram sent to you yesterday. When inserting, make up info if necessary. Write query for each step. Do not use IDE. BE CAREFUL WHEN DELETING DATA OR DROPPING TABLE.
1.	Lock tables Region, Territories, EmployeeTerritories and Employees. Insert following information into the database. In case of an error, no changes should be made to DB.
a.	A new region called “Middle Earth”;
b.	A new territory called “Gondor”, belongs to region “Middle Earth”;
c.	A new employee “Aragorn King” who's territory is “Gondor”.
2.	Change territory “Gondor” to “Arnor”.
3.	Delete Region “Middle Earth”. (tip: remove referenced data first) (Caution: do not forget WHERE or you will delete everything.) In case of an error, no changes should be made to DB. Unlock the tables mentioned in question 1.
4.	Create a view named “view_product_order_[your_last_name]”, list all products and total ordered quantity for that product.
5.	Create a stored procedure “sp_product_order_quantity_[your_last_name]” that accept product id as an input and total quantities of order as output parameter.
6.	Create a stored procedure “sp_product_order_city_[your_last_name]” that accept product name as an input and top 5 cities that ordered most that product combined with the total quantity of that product ordered from that city as output.
7.	Lock tables Region, Territories, EmployeeTerritories and Employees. Create a stored procedure “sp_move_employees_[your_last_name]” that automatically find all employees in territory “Tory”; if more than 0 found, insert a new territory “Stevens Point” of region “North” to the database, and then move those employees to “Stevens Point”.
8.	Create a trigger that when there are more than 100 employees in territory “Stevens Point”, move them back to Troy. (After test your code,) remove the trigger. Move those employees back to “Troy”, if any. Unlock the tables.
9.	Create 2 new tables “people_your_last_name” “city_your_last_name”. City table has two records: {Id:1, City: Seattle}, {Id:2, City: Green Bay}. People has three records: {id:1, Name: Aaron Rodgers, City: 2}, {id:2, Name: Russell Wilson, City:1}, {Id: 3, Name: Jody Nelson, City:2}. Remove city of Seattle. If there was anyone from Seattle, put them into a new city “Madison”. Create a view “Packers_your_name” lists all people from Green Bay. If any error occurred, no changes should be made to DB. (after test) Drop both tables and view.
10.	 Create a stored procedure “sp_birthday_employees_[you_last_name]” that creates a new table “birthday_employees_your_last_name” and fill it with all employees that have a birthday on Feb. (Make a screen shot) drop the table. Employee table should not be affected.
11.	Create a stored procedure named “sp_your_last_name_1” that returns all cites that have at least 2 customers who have bought no or only one kind of product. Create a stored procedure named “sp_your_last_name_2” that returns the same but using a different approach. (sub-query and no-sub-query).
12.	How do you make sure two tables have the same data?
14.
First Name	Last Name	Middle Name
John	Green	
Mike	White	M
Output should be
Full Name
John Green
Mike White M.
Note: There is a dot after M when you output.
15.
Student	Marks	Sex
Ci	70	F
Bob	80	M
Li	90	F
Mi	95	M
Find the top marks of Female students.
If there are to students have the max score, only output one.
16.
Student	Marks	Sex
Li	90	F
Ci	70	F
Mi	95	M
Bob	80	M
How do you out put this?

GOOD  LUCK.
